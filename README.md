## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication & Authorization**

	* User registration with server-side validation (`Zod`), collision checks and hashing (`bcryptjs`)
  * Secure credential-based login with [`NextAuth.js`](https://next-auth.js.org/) and JWT strategy
  * Role-based access control (`User`, `Admin`) enforced via custom `middleware.js`

* **Service Connection System**

  * Users can submit new connection requests with a chosen plan, address, and connection type
  * Connections become available for activation after approval by an admin in the control panel

* **Client Dashboard**

  * Full control over client's subscriptions: connection activation, plan change, auto-renewal toggle
  * Activation with prorated cost based on remaining days in the month, wrapped in a secure SQL transaction
  * Balance top-ups and connection activations are automatically logged in the Transactions table

* **Recurring Billing System**

  * Automated billing at the start of each month for active connections with auto-renewal enabled, implemented via MySQL Events
  * Manual event trigger available in the admin panel

* **Admin Panel**

  * Full CRUD for Users, Plans, and Connections
  * Traffic plan and connection type usage statistics
  * Safe updates with role-gated access control

* **DevOps & Infrastructure**

  * **Docker Compose:** Fully containerized stack (Next.js + MySQL + Redis) that can be spun up with one command
  * **Redis:** Traffic plans caching with TTL and cache invalidation when plans are created or edited
  * **GitHub Actions:** Automated Docker image build and upload to GitHub Container Registry on each push

### Tables Overview

| Table          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Users**      | Stores user accounts with credentials, balance, and assigned role        |
| **Plans**      | Contains available traffic plans with pricing and specifications           |
| **Connections**| Tracks service subscriptions with status and billing preferences         |
| **Transactions**| Logs all financial transactions including top-ups and service payments      |

### Key Relationships
- One-to-Many: `Users` ‚Üí `Connections` (A user can have multiple connections)
- One-to-Many: `Plans` ‚Üí `Connections` (A plan can be used by multiple connections)
- One-to-Many: `Users` ‚Üí `Transactions` (A user can have multiple transactions)

Run this command twice to generate a random NextAuth secret and MySQL password (Linux/macOS/WSL):
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Then create `.env` file in project root:
```ini
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_generated_password_here
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
```

#### 3. Start the app

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### 4. Access the frontend

[``http://localhost:3000``](http://localhost:3000)
